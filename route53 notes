Route 53:
==========
Highly available and scalable DNS.

In AWS, Route53 is global managed DNS (Domain Name System) & we already know DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
DNS operates on port 53. Amazon decided to call it route 53 so thatâ€™s where the name comes from.

Record sets:

A - It indicates the IP address of a given domain OR Name to IP
mX - Domain name of an email server
NS - Identifies the name server of a hosted zone
PTR - IP to name record
SOA - The start of authority (SOA) record. The start of authority (SOA) record identifies the base DNS information about the domain
CNAME - Alias name of the domain ( name server)
AAAA - An AAAA record is used to find the IP address of a computer connected to the internet from a name.

Routing policies are,
Simple routing policy --> Use to route internet traffic to a single resource that performs a given function for your domain.
Failover routing policy  -->Use when you want to configure active-passive failover
Geolocation routing policy --> Use when you want to route internet traffic to your resources based on the location of your users.
Latency routing policy --> Use when you have resources in multiple locations and you want to route traffic to the resource that provides the best latency
Weighted routing policy -> Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.

================================================

Hosted Zone?

A hosted zone is a container for records and records contain information about how you want to route
traffic for a specific domain such as example.com and it's subdomains (india.example.com & china.example.com)

There are two types of hosted zones:

Private hosted zones --contains records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC
Public hosted zones --contains records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet
