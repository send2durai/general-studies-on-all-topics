Following commands are frequently used in prod linux/centos OS,

1) Scenario one:

Linux admin should have to copy the log files from log directory to /tmp directory. Example, there is apache application hosted and middleware team wanted to review the catalina logs? How would you do? 

Note: In log directory, we see ocean of log files existing. In that, you need to filter the logs and copy the particular dataes logs to temp directory.

Answer is:

a) Login to app instance that should be a deployed & running on Cloud or On-prem envi.
b) Once logged naviagte to the directory using cd
$ cd /var/log/apache/access.log
$ cd /etc/httpd/logs/access_log
$ cd /var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out 
$ ls -ltr | grep catalina*
$ ls -ltr | grep catalina * | grep 'Jun 2'   --> to specific date filtering

$ tar -czvf /tmp/murugan_log.tar.gz *   --> To archieve and compress all files in a particular directory to the temp dierectory with the name of murugan_log.tar.gz

$ tar -vtf /tmp/murugan_log.tar.gz  ---> list the content (including original file sizes) of the tar file using

Note: whate we are doing here is just, we already gone to /var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out directory and we filter the specific dates logs, compressing the specific dates logs and moving from log directory to temp directory.


2) Scenario two:

You're a new to the linux/cloud team, where you need to manage and administer around 200 Linux boxes. You should login to the each servers for the first time to reset the one-time password shared by admin team. Then you need to setup passwordless authentication in all the machines, how would you do?

Answer is:

Typically all the organizations used to keep a Jump host or bashiton on the infra, which has internet connectivity and management network connectivity, in which we can login to the all the DEV/CERT/PROD linux boxes.

Steps that are required to setup password less authentication,

a) Generate keypair using ssh-keygen
b) By default the pri/pub-keys are stored in user profile under .ssh/ directory.
Example: /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa.pub authorized_key
Note: You should copy the id_rsa.pub file to all the remote nodes, which you wanted to access them via passwordless authentication.
$ ssh-keygen
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ec2-user@app-svr1

when you copying the id_rsa.pub file, first time it will ask us to enter the current password. Please enter it. 
Next time onwards, you need to supply the password, just use below method,

ssh app-srv1 ===> You will be able connect it w/o password.

Note: Private key is always keep in jumphost or your computer. We shouldn't share the private key to anyone. Public key is always keep in public machines.
