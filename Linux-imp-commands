### Linux important commands

## Grep --Global regular expression print

# grep -i Permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

here '-i' mean, it doesn't check, whether it will be small or capital of a word you're searching

# ls -l | grep ^d --> it only filter and give you directories of a specific path

# ls -l /etc/ssh/ | grep ^d  

-----------------
SED - stands for stream editor, which is used to search a word in the file and replace it with the word required
to be in the output.

Note: It will only modify the output, but there will be no change in the original file

Example,

sed 's/ansible/linux/' file
sed 's/ansible/linux/g' file -->  'g'- global .It replaces ansible to linux in all the places in a file
sed 's/ansible/linux/ig' file  --> it wont consider, the ansible is starts from Upper or lower cases
sed -i 's/ansible/linux/' file1
sed -i 's/ansible/linux/g' file1
sed -i 's/ansible/linux/ig' file1

# sed -n '5,10p' file1
# sed -n '5,10d' file1

# sed 's/#/ /' file1  --> searching only with '#' lines
