What is etcd in kubernetes (k8's)?

ETCD:
=====
ETCD is a distributed reliable key-value store that is simple, secure and fast.
ETCD is a database that store information in a key-value format
[Key=value]
The ETCD database store information regarding the cluster, cluster such as nodes, pods, configs,secrets, accounts, roles,bindings
and others.
Every Information, you see when you run the 'kubectl' get command is from the ETCD database.
ETCD starts a service that listens on port 2379 by default, very important.

How to take backup of ETCD and Restore?

### Taking backup using snapshot method:

root@techtalk:~# etcdctl -version
root@techtalk:~# kubectl -n kube-system get pod
root@techtalk:~# kubectl -n kube-system describe pod etcd-controlplane
root@techtalk:~# kubectl get deployments.apps
root@techtalk:~# kubectl -n kube-system describe pod etcd-controlplane
## Note: Just refer kubernetes documentation, where check etcd snapshot.

root@techtalk:~# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

Once, you execute this command, you'll get Snapshot saved at /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

If you execute this command, you wont see anything below,
# kubetctl get deployments.apps
No resoruces found in default namespace.
# kubectl get pod
No resoruces found in default namespace.

### Restore the etcd database backup:

root@techtalk:~# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-backup snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

root@techtalk:~# cd /var/lib/
root@techtalk:~# ls 
root@techtalk:~# cd /etc/kubernetes/mainfests/
root@techtalk:~# ls
etcd.yaml kube-apiserver.yaml kube-controller-manager.yaml kube-scheduler.yaml
 root@techtalk:~# vi etcd.yaml --> edit and change the path
find the path,
path: /var/lib/etcd-backup
Esc:wq! [save and quit]

root@techtalk:~# docker ps | grep etcd
root@techtalk:~# kubectl get deployments.apps  
NAME  READY  UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE AGE
blue  3/3      3            3        16m
red   2/2      2            2        16m

 root@techtalk:~# kubectl get pod --> to see the running pods
